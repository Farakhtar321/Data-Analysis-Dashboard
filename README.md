# Carbon Emission Insights (Interactive dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize CO₂ emissions from multiple perspectives — yearly trends, major contributing items, and statewise breakdown — to identify key sources and patterns for better environmental decision-making.

## Dataset Used
-<a href = "https://github.com/Farakhtar321/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%2BDesign%2BData%2BSet.csv"> Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
– What is the total CO₂ emitted.
– By what percentage have CO₂ emissions increased or decreased year-over-year?
– Which items or sectors are responsible for the highest share of emissions?
– Which states have the highest total CO₂ emissions?
– What percentage of total emissions does each state contribute?
– What is the proportion of different emission types in each state?
– Which state leads in each type of emission?
