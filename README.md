# Carbon Emission Insights (Interactive dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize CO₂ emissions from multiple perspectives — yearly trends, major contributing items, and statewise breakdown — to identify key sources and patterns for better environmental decision-making.

## Dataset Used
-<a href = "https://github.com/Farakhtar321/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%2BDesign%2BData%2BSet.csv"> Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

– What is the total CO₂ emitted.
– By what percentage have CO₂ emissions increased or decreased year-over-year?
– Which items or sectors are responsible for the highest share of emissions?
– Which states have the highest total CO₂ emissions?
– What percentage of total emissions does each state contribute?
– What is the proportion of different emission types in each state?
– Which state leads in each type of emission?

  ## Project Insights.
  -Overall Trend: CO₂ emissions have steadily increased from 2019 to 2022, with 2022 being the worst year in the period studied.
  -Top Source: Paper and folder production is the largest single contributor to emissions.
  -State Hotspots:
    ~California produces the highest share of emissions at 33%.
    ~Texas follows with 20%.
  -Combined Impact: California and Texas together account for over half of total emissions, making them critical focus areas for emission reduction.

  ## Final Conclusion.
   -CO₂ emissions rose steadily from 2019 to 2022, peaking in 2022. The biggest contributor is paper and folder production, with California (33%) and Texas (20%) together              responsible for over half of total emissions. Targeted action in these areas could yield the greatest reduction in overall emissions.
