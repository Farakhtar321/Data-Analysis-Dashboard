# Carbon Emission Insights (Interactive dashboard creation using Tableau)
## Project Objective
To identify major CO₂ sources and high-emission regions so businesses can target sustainability efforts where they will have the greatest impact.

## Dataset Used
-<a href = "https://github.com/Farakhtar321/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%2BDesign%2BData%2BSet.csv"> Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

– What is the total CO₂ emitted.

– By what percentage have CO₂ emissions increased or decreased year-over-year?

– Which items or sectors are responsible for the highest share of emissions?

– Which states have the highest total CO₂ emissions?

– What percentage of total emissions does each state contribute?

– What is the proportion of different emission types in each state?

– Which state leads in each type of emission?

  ## Project Insights.
  -Rising Risk: CO₂ emissions increased consistently from 2019 to 2022, with 2022 marking the highest level—indicating growing environmental and regulatory risk.
  
  -Top Source: Paper and folder production is the largest single contributor to emissions.
  
  -Regional Concentration: California (33%) and Texas (20%) together account for over half of total emissions, meaning focused interventions here could deliver maximum impact with    minimal resource spread.
  
  -Operational Opportunity: Targeting high-emission states and high-emission products aligns with ESG goals, reduces potential carbon tax liabilities, and improves brand              reputation.

  ## Final Conclusion.
   -The data shows a clear upward trend in emissions, peaking in 2022, with paper and folder production in California and Texas driving the majority of the impact. From a business standpoint, prioritizing digital transformation, supply chain optimization, and state-focused emission reduction programs could significantly cut costs, lower future compliance risks, and strengthen sustainability credentials—delivering both environmental and financial returns.
